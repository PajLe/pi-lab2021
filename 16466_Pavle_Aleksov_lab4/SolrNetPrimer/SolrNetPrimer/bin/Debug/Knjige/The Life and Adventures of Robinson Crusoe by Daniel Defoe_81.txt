a hundred yards broad, and
about twice as long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the
end of it, descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by
the seaside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill; so that it was
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun,
or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow place,
which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and
twenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them
into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end
being out of the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened on
the top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid
them in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two
rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside,
leaning against them, about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a
post; and this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could
get into it or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour,
especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and
drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by a
short ladder to go over the top; which
