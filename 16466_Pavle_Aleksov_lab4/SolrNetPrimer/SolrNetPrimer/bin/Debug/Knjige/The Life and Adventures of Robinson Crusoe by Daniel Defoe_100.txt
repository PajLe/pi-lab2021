killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not
what to call it.

_Nov._ 17.—This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to
make room for my further conveniency.

_Note_.—Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work—viz. a pickaxe,
a shovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and
began to consider how to supply that want, and make me some tools. As
for the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper
enough, though heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this
was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing
effectually without it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.

_Nov._ 18.—The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that
wood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron-tree, for its
exceeding hardness. Of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my
axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough,
for it was exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my
having no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I
worked it effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or
spade; the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the
board part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me
so long; however, it served well enough for the uses which I had
occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after
that fashion, or so long in making.
