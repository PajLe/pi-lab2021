rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal
circumstances I was brought to—viz. I had neither food, house, clothes,
weapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw nothing
but death before me—either that I should be devoured by wild beasts,
murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the
approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but
slept soundly, though it rained all night.

_October_ 1.—In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had
floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer
the island; which, as it was some comfort, on one hand—for, seeing her
set upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I
might get on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my
relief—so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my
comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have
saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all drowned
as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to have carried us to some
other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing
myself on these things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I
went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. This day
also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.
